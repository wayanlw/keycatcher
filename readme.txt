Key Catcher is a simple keyboard activity recorder. It is intended as an administrative tool for legitimate monitoring of your own computer, or any computer on which you are authorized to use it. It is illegal to use this or any activity monitoring software on any computer without the knowledge and permission of the owner. What you choose to do with Key Catcher is solely your responsibility, as are any consequences which may result.

Key Catcher is free for both business and personal use. It can be freely modified and redistributed providing that, 1. all notices remain intact, 2. you acknowledge where it originally came from, 3. it is only used for legal and ethical purposes, 4. no profit is derived from its distribution.

Features:
   Monitors most common keys and key combinations.
   Can optionally record mouse activity.
   Writes activity to log.txt in the application folder.
   Customizable tray icons.
   Portable, can run from removable media and makes no changes to the host system.
   Open source, written in AutoHotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com).

Requirements:
   Windows 2000/XP (untested on Vista and Win7).
   A keyboard and mouse.

Known bugs:
   When read from the log some text may be a little confusing do to the endkey requirement (see recognized keys file).
   Sometimes odd symbols are written to the log. When the log is viewed in Notepad these symbols will appear as a square.
   Since part of Key Catcher uses hotkeys, use of other AHk based programs or scripts may result in conflicts. The most recently launched program will generally take precedence.

Thanks to:
   Mr. Jody Holmes of http://skwire.dcmembers.com for his patience in answering several AHk related questions.
